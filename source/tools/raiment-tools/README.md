# raiment-tools

A unified webapp with a set of small tools for this monorepo.

## TODO

## Design

- All tools have been bundled into one webapp to (1) reduce the complexity of running and/or discovering individual tools and (2) consolidate the overhead of build configuration and tooling to one place. This does come at the expense of slower builds and some one-off build steps particular to one tool.
